    This is my take on Binary Trees.
    I would like to thank the youtuber "WilliamFiset" for a very good explanation on Binary Trees.
    I was inspired and created this.

    This implementation of mine comes with generic typing, for flexibility. Although i think I will
    only support primitive data types...

    📌 Planning to implement:
        Remove Function
        Search Function
        Other Display Fucntions using Other traversal methods
        
        Balancing (if I can)
    📬 Pesronal Message to self:
        Wow, Trees nata, how about ang Hash Table?? Need pa tun-an no?? Libug man gud ang hashing HAHAHAHAHA!!
        Anyways, keep learning mah nigga!!
